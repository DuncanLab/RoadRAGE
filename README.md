## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 2018.2 or above.
- Your PC must meet the minimum requirements to run Unity, found [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements).
- Mac OSX or Windows 10 are preferred, but the project should still behave normally on most Linux distros.

### Installation - from source
To use this software in your experiments you will need to download the
following software packages: **Unity3D, Road RAGE source code**.

1. Download and Install Unity
   1. Go to: https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal.
   2. Follow Installation instructions for your specific computer.
   3. Open the Unity application and create an account or login.

2. Download RoadRAGE source code
   1. Go to https://github.com/DuncanLab/RoadRAGE (you're already here!).
   2. In the grey dropdown on the left side of the page called 'branch' make sure.
      that **master** is selected. Alternatively, checkout the [releases section](https://github.com/DuncanLab/RoadRAGE/releases)
      for the latest release.
   3. Now, click the green button on the right hand side called **Clone or
      Download** and make sure to select **Download ZIP**.
   4. Unzip the file you downloaded in an easy to access place. For example, your
      desktop.

3. Set up Unity with RoadRAGE
   1. Open the Unity application.
   2. If you have not done so already, please log in or create a free account.
   3. Once signed in, click **Open** near the top right of the window.
   4. Navigate to and select the folder that you just unzipped/cloned. Select the folder and click **Open**.
   5. If you receive any warnings from Unity upon opening the folder, simply click
      continue and Unity will begin loading the project. *This takes time! Lots of assets need to be processed so please be patient.*
   7. Once the process is complete, Unity will open. Select the `Start` scene from `Assets/Scenes` and press the play button to run the simulation.

Congratulations! You have set up the RoadRAGE project.
